# Euclidean Algorithm

This is a simple Python application that demonstrates the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a tkinter GUI.

## Features

- Calculate GCD: Enter two numbers and click "Calculate GCD" to see the step-by-step process and the result.
- Clear: Click "Clear" to reset the input fields and output.

## Getting Started

To run the application, clone the repository and run the `euclidean_algorithm.py` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
python euclidean_algorithm.py
